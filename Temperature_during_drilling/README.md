# Case championship descripsion
---
In this case, our team focused on predicting bottom-hole temperature during the drilling process. We used EDA, correlation analysis, data preprocessing, pipeline development, scaling, and cross-validation to find a better solution.

The pipeline we adopted included three models: LightGBM, Random Forest, and CatBoost. It was a bagging process. The RMSE on test data was about 7Â°F (Fahrenheit).
